--GANs are generative models: after given some training data, they can create new data instances that look like your training data. 
--GAN composes of two types of models: Generative Model and a Discriminative Model.
--Generative Models are responsible for generating different kinds of noise data whereas discriminative models are responsible to discriminate whether the given data is real or fake.
--Discriminator in GAN uses a cross entropy loss (binary classifier--> real or fake), since discriminators job is to classify; cross entropy loss is the best one out there.
